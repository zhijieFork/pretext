### Implementation notes

- The published package ships built ESM from `dist/`; `dist/` is publish-time output, not checked-in source.
- Keep shipped library source imports runtime-honest with `.js` specifiers inside `.ts` files. That keeps plain `tsc` emit producing correct JS and `.d.ts` files without a declaration rewrite step.
- `prepare()` / `prepareWithSegments()` do horizontal-only work. `layout()` / `layoutWithLines()` take explicit `lineHeight`.
- `setLocale(locale?)` retargets the hoisted word segmenter for future `prepare()` calls and clears shared caches. Use it before preparing new text when the app wants a specific `Intl.Segmenter` locale instead of the runtime default.
- `prepare()` should stay the opaque fast-path handle. If a page/script needs segment arrays, that should usually flow through `prepareWithSegments()` instead of re-exposing internals on the main prepared type.
- The rich public surface is intentionally split between stats/range helpers (`walkLineRanges()`, `measureLineStats()`, `layoutNextLineRange()`) and text-materializing helpers (`layoutWithLines()`, `layoutNextLine()`, `materializeLineRange()`). Keep their break semantics aligned.
- `walkLineRanges()` is the rich-path batch range API: no string materialization, but still browser-like line widths/cursors/discretionary-hyphen state. Prefer it over private line walkers for shrinkwrap or aggregate layout work.
- Keep prepare-time diagnostics internal to benchmark tooling. Do not grow a second public prepare surface just to expose timing splits.
- `prepare()` is internally split into a text-analysis phase and a measurement phase; keep that seam clear, but keep the public API simple unless requirements force a change.
- The internal segment model now distinguishes at least eight break kinds: normal text, collapsible spaces, preserved spaces, tabs, non-breaking glue (`NBSP` / `NNBSP` / `WJ`-like runs), zero-width break opportunities, soft hyphens, and hard breaks. Do not collapse those back into one boolean unless the model gets richer in a better way.
- `layout()` is the resize hot path: no DOM reads, no canvas calls, no string work, and avoid gratuitous allocations.
- Segment metrics cache is `Map<font, Map<segment, metrics>>`; shared across texts and resettable via `clearCache()`. Width is only one cached fact now; grapheme widths and other segment-derived facts can be populated lazily.
- Word and grapheme segmenters are hoisted at module scope. Any locale reset should also clear the word cache.
- Punctuation is merged into preceding word-like segments only, never into spaces.
- Keep script-specific break-policy fixes in preprocessing, not `layout()`. That includes Arabic no-space punctuation clusters, Arabic punctuation-plus-mark clusters, and `" " + combining marks` before Arabic text.
- `NBSP`-style glue should survive `prepare()` as visible content and prevent ordinary word-boundary wrapping; `ZWSP` should survive as a zero-width break opportunity.
- Soft hyphens should stay invisible when unbroken, but if the engine chooses that break, the broken line should expose a visible trailing hyphen in `layoutWithLines()`.
- If a soft hyphen wins the break, the rich line APIs should still expose the visible trailing `-` in `line.text`, even though the public line types do not currently carry a separate soft-hyphen metadata flag.
- `layoutNextLine()` is the rich-path escape hatch for variable-width userland layout. It now hides its grapheme-cache bookkeeping again by internally splitting line stepping from text materialization. Keep that internal split semantically aligned with `layoutWithLines()`, but do not pull its extra bookkeeping into the hot `layout()` path.
- Astral CJK ideographs, compatibility ideographs, and the later extension blocks must still hit the CJK path; do not rely on BMP-only `charCodeAt()` checks there.
- Non-word, non-space segments are break opportunities, same as words.
- CJK grapheme splitting plus kinsoku merging keeps prohibited punctuation attached to adjacent graphemes.
- Emoji correction is auto-detected per font size, constant per emoji grapheme, and effectively font-independent.
- Bidi levels now stay on the rich `prepareWithSegments()` path as custom-rendering metadata only. The opaque fast `prepare()` handle should not pay for bidi metadata that `layout()` does not consume, and line breaking itself does not read those levels.
- The rich-path bidi classifier now comes from checked-in generated Unicode range data. Refresh it manually with `bun run generate:bidi-data`; do not turn that into a normal build step.
- A larger pure-TS Unicode stack like `text-shaper` is useful as reference material, especially for Unicode coverage and richer bidi metadata, but its runtime segmentation and greedy glyph-line breaker are not replacements for our browser-facing `Intl.Segmenter` + preprocessing + canvas-measurement model.
- Supported CSS target is still the common app-text configuration: `white-space: normal`, `word-break: normal`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`, `line-break: auto`.
- There is also an explicit opt-in `{ wordBreak: 'keep-all' }` mode for CJK/Hangul text and CJK-leading no-space mixed-script runs; keep its policy work in preprocessing, not `layout()`.
- There is now a second explicit whitespace mode, `{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }`, for ordinary spaces, `\t` tabs, and `\n` hard breaks. Tabs follow the default browser-style tab stops. Treat it as editor/input-oriented, not the whole CSS `pre-wrap` surface.
- Keep the permanent `pre-wrap` coverage small and explicit. A one-time raw-source validation was useful, but the standing repo coverage should stay a compact oracle set rather than a giant sweep over wiki scaffolding.
- That default target means narrow widths may still break inside words, but only at grapheme boundaries. Keep the core engine honest to that behavior; if an editorial page wants stricter whole-word handling, layer it on top in userland instead of quietly changing the library default.
- `system-ui` is unsafe for accuracy; canvas and DOM can resolve different fonts on macOS.
- Accuracy pages and checkers are now expected to be green in all three installed browsers on fresh runs; if a page disagrees, suspect stale tabs/servers before changing the algorithm.
- The browser automation lock is self-healing for stale dead-owner files now, but it is still single-owner per browser. If a checker times out on the lock, confirm a live checker process still owns it before changing the algorithm.
- Accuracy and corpus checkers can use background-safe browser automation, but benchmark runs should stay foreground. Do not “optimize away” benchmark focus; throttled/background tabs make the numbers less trustworthy.
- Accuracy and the maintained `step=10` corpus sweep paths now batch widths in-page after a single navigation. Prefer those sweep entrypoints over userland “navigate once per width” loops, and keep the slow single-width checkers for diagnosis.
- Keep the transport split deliberate: small automation reports can ride the hash, but large batched reports should use the local POST side channel instead of stuffing every row into `#report=...`.
- Browser-automation timeouts now report the last page phase they saw (`loading`, `measuring`, or `posting`). Treat `posting` timeouts as transport-side clues first; they usually point at the report side channel rather than the text engine.
- For deep perf or memory work, prefer an isolated debuggable Chrome over a pure Bun microbenchmark. Bun is fine for quick hypotheses, but Chrome profiling is the better source of truth for CPU hotspots, allocation churn, and retained-heap checks.
- Refresh `benchmarks/chrome.json` and `benchmarks/safari.json` when a diff changes benchmark methodology or the text engine hot path (`src/analysis.ts`, `src/measurement.ts`, `src/line-break.ts`, `src/layout.ts`, `src/bidi.ts`, or `pages/benchmark.ts`). Regenerate `status/dashboard.json` after those snapshot changes.
- `bun start` is the stable human-facing dev server. The scripted checkers intentionally keep using `--no-hmr` temporary servers so their runs stay deterministic and easy to tear down.
- Do not run multiple browser corpus/sweep/font-matrix jobs in parallel against the same browser. The automation session and temporary page server paths interfere with each other and can make a healthy corpus look hung or flaky.
- An `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` tab on `localhost:3210` or a similar temporary checker port usually means you caught a per-run Bun server after teardown. That is expected after the script exits; it is not, by itself, evidence of a bad measurement.
- Keep `src/layout.test.ts` small and durable. For browser-specific or narrow hypothesis work, prefer throwaway probes/scripts and promote only the stable invariants into permanent tests.
- For long-form corpus canary work, use the checked-in `step=10` sweep first and only diagnose the mismatching widths in detail. The slow detailed checker is for narrowing root causes, not for every width by default.
- For Arabic corpus/probe work, use normalized slices, the exact corpus font, and the RTL `Range`-based diagnostics. Raw offsets or rough fallback fonts will mislead you.
- For `pre-wrap` probe work, Safari span extraction is currently a better cross-check than Safari `Range` extraction around preserved spaces and hard breaks. Keep using `Range` for the default `white-space: normal` diagnostics unless the mode itself is the thing under test.
- For Southeast Asian and Arabic/Urdu raw-diagnostic work, keep using the script-appropriate extractor instead of forcing one Safari rule everywhere.
- The corpus/probe diagnostic pages now compute our line offsets directly from prepared segments and grapheme fallbacks; do not go back to reconstructing them from `layoutWithLines().line.text.length`.
- `/corpus`, `corpus-check`, and `corpus-sweep` now accept `font` / `lineHeight` overrides. Use those before inventing a second page or checker when the question is “does this same corpus stay healthy under another font?”
- Prefer Chrome for the first font-matrix pass. Safari font-matrix automation is slower and noisier, so treat it as follow-up smoke coverage.
- Mixed app text is now a first-class canary. Use it to catch product-shaped classes like URL/query-string wrapping, emoji ZWJ runs, and mixed-script punctuation before tuning another book corpus.
- URL-like runs such as `https://...` / `www...` are currently modeled as two breakable preprocessing units when a query exists: the path through the query introducer (`?`), then the query string. This is intentionally narrow and exists to stop obviously bad mid-path URL breaks without forcing the whole query string to fragment character-by-character.
- Mixed app text also pulled in two more keep-worthy preprocessing rules: contextual escaped quote clusters like `\"word\"`, and numeric/time-range runs like `२४×७` / `7:00-9:00`.
- For Southeast Asian scripts or mixed text containing Thai/Lao/Khmer/Myanmar, trust the `Range`-based corpus diagnostics over span-probing; span units can perturb line breaking there.
- The remaining Chrome mixed-app `710px` soft-hyphen miss is extractor-sensitive and not cleanly local. Treat it as paragraph-scale / accumulation-sensitive until a cleaner reproducer appears, and do not patch the engine from only one extractor view.
- Safari `Range`-based probe extraction can over-advance across URL query text (`...path?q`) even when the real DOM height and the `span` extractor are exact. Cross-check `--method=span` before changing the engine on Safari URL/query probe misses.
- Keep the current corpus lessons in mind:
  - Thai: contextual ASCII quotes were a real keep
  - Khmer: explicit zero-width separators from clean source text are useful signal
  - Lao: wrapped raw-law text was a bad canary and was rejected
  - Myanmar: punctuation/medial-glue keeps survived, broader Chrome-only fixes did not
  - Japanese: kana iteration marks are CJK line-start-prohibited
  - Chinese: the remaining broad Chrome-positive field is real and not obviously another punctuation bug
- The corpus diagnostics should derive our candidate lines from `layoutWithLines()`, not from a second local line-walker. That avoids SHY and future custom-break drift between the hot path and the diagnostic path.
- Current line-fit tolerance is `0.005` for Chromium/Gecko and `1/64` for Safari/WebKit. That bump was justified by the remaining Arabic fine-width field and did not move the solved browser corpus or the English long-form canary.
- Refresh `accuracy/chrome.json`, `accuracy/safari.json`, and `accuracy/firefox.json` when a diff changes the browser sweep methodology or the main text engine behavior (`src/analysis.ts`, `src/measurement.ts`, `src/line-break.ts`, `src/layout.ts`, `src/bidi.ts`, or `pages/accuracy.ts`).
- Refresh `corpora/chrome-step10.json` and then regenerate `corpora/dashboard.json` when the corpus sweep methodology or long-form canary behavior changes in a way that moves the dashboard counts.
- Refresh `corpora/safari-step10.json` alongside `corpora/chrome-step10.json` when the corpus sweep methodology or long-form canary behavior changes in a way that moves the dashboard counts.
